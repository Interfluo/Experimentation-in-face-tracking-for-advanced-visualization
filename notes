- Laid down some of the groundwork for getting the face location and doing basic operations from this
- a lot of work need to be done to implement this in ParaView, VTK, or some other visualization tool with the
  appropriate projection matrices, etc...
- there is a lot to do, and I am playing it a bit by ear as to where this project will go.

6/15
- started implementing pyglet for creating and manipulating the 3d geometry. Still need much more work, but so far I can
  rotate and translate a basic shape on the screen. This need to be coupled with the face tracking to adjust based on
  the position of the users head.
- started exploring imageAI to see if it is possible to accelerate or stabilize face detection with other methods
- will likely stick to the haar cascade and add some temporal smoothing by averaging over frames (we will see..)
- good progress so far, but I still have a lot to do.

6/15.2
- added a function that imports an ascii formatted stl, gets the vertex data, and creates an edges matrix. This can then
  be imported into the previously developed pygame code to view an stl file.

TODO:
    - comment the code (soon)
    - optimize the performance of the stl reader for bigger cases (future)
    - add shading (future)
    - ....
